#Docker - Nginx image only allows /usr/src/app as target directory

  After several try & errors it is clear: NGINX Docker allowes only /usr/src/app as target.

  I tried /usr/shared/ngnix/html as directory.
  But the content was build in it, but was always removed on docker container start.

  Maybe there can be setup a command for it after running.
